# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

I was asked to create a scheduler that allows the user to make a list of their tasks that will save to local storage. The time will display on the left column and as the time passes the colour will change to mark past, presnt and future tasks. I really struggled with this portion of the task and could not complete it.

You can see the planner is laid out, you have the time, you can input your tasks and save them to the local strage.
